  <pre><b>NAME</b>
        <i>sdk install</i> - sdk subcommand to install a candidate version

    <b>SYNOPSIS</b>
        <i>sdk install &lt;candidate&gt; [version] [path]</i>

    <b>DESCRIPTION</b>
        Invoking this subcommand with only the candidate as
        parameter will install the currently known default
        version for that candidate. Provide a second
        qualifier to install a specific non-default version.
        Provide a third optional qualifier to add an
        already installed local version. This final qualifier
        is the absolute local path to the base directory of
        the SDK to be added. The local version will appear
        as an installed version of the candidate. The
        version may not conflict with an existing version,
        installed or not.

    <b>EXIT CODE</b>
        The subcommand will return a non-zero exit code for
        versions not found or for an invalid path.

    <b>MNEMONIC</b>
        <b>i</b> - may be used in place of the <b>install</b> subcommand.
