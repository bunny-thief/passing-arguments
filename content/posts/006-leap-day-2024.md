Summary: In honor of Leap day, I wrote a small Go program that checks if the current date is a leap day. It uses constants and functions from the time package.

## Overview

In honor of [Leap day](https://airandspace.si.edu/stories/editorial/science-leap-year 'The Science of Leap Year'), I wrote a small [Go](https://go.dev/ 'Go.dev') program that checks if the current date is a leap day. It uses constants and functions from the [time package](https://pkg.go.dev/time@go1.22.0 'time package').

## Code

Here is the full code for this program. It starts out by saving the current local time and printing the date to the console with the `time.UnixDate` format. The local month and local day are then parsed and saved to `currentMonth` and `currentDay` variables respectively.

A conditional check is then performed which checks if `currentMonth` is equal to 'February' and the `currentDay` is equal to 29. If both conditions are true, it prints `Happy Leap Day!` to the console. If `currentMonth` is not 'February' or `currentDay` is not 29, then it prints `Today is not a leap day.`

The repo can be found here [leap-day](https://github.com/Stuttgart-Gophers/leap-day 'Leap Day Repo').

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"time"
)

func main() {
	now := time.Now()
	fmt.Println(now.Format(time.UnixDate))

	currentMonth := now.Local().Month()
	currentDay := now.Local().Day()

	if currentMonth.String() == "February" && currentDay == 29 {
		fmt.Println("Happy Leap Day!")
	} else {
		fmt.Println("Today is not a leap day.")
	}

}
```

## Output

Running the program prints the current time in [UnixDate](https://pkg.go.dev/time#example-Time.Format 'time.UnixDate') format Which looks like this "Mon Jan 2 15:04:05 MST 2006" and short message which confirms it is a leap day or not.

{{< 006-leap-day-2024/leap-day-true >}}

On non-leap days, this message is printed instead.

{{< 006-leap-day-2024/leap-day-false >}}

## Main Takeaway

This nifty Go program will tell you if the current day is a leap day.

Leap Day is like the Olympics of Non-Government Recognized Holidays. It only comes around every four years so make it count. Happy Leap Day!
